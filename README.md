Banks offer various product such as accounts and services to their customers. In order to gain more profit, most bank in the world run marketing campaigns to promote specific products like credit cards, savings accounts, or loans. These campaigns usually target existing customers, but they need to be cost-effective to maximize profit.

This project focuses on a specific marketing campaign which is the telemarketing push for term deposits offered by a bank. The goal is to analyze customer data from this campaign to understand patterns and improve future marketing efforts. The data includes information about all customers contacted during a year to promote term deposits and hopefully build stronger, longer-term relationships with them.

Term deposits is very similar to fixed deposit which are investments where depositor lock up their money for a set period (1 month to 5 years) in exchange for a guaranteed interest rate. These rates are typically higher than what you'd get with a regular savings account for the fixed deposit. This project dives into a bank's telemarketing campaign for term deposits to identify areas where the bank can put more effort and convince more customers to sign up for term deposits.

In this project the dataset that been used was retrieved from Bank Marketing Dataset The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
